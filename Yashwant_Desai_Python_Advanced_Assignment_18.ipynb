Binary files are hard to read for humans, and errors can be tricky to handle. It's also less flexible for complex data and lacks built-in checks for data accuracy. It's usually better to use higher-level formats like text or data serialization for safer and more portable data storage."

    "A significant benefit of using the with keyword in Python for file operations, as opposed to explicitly opening and closing files, is that it ensures proper file handling and automatic resource management. When you use with, Python takes care of opening the file, executing the block of code, and then closing the file when the block is exited, whether it exits normally or due to an exception. This ensures that the file is always closed, preventing resource leaks and potential data corruption. It simplifies file management, makes the code cleaner, and reduces the chances of forgetting to close a file, which is a common source of errors when working with files."
